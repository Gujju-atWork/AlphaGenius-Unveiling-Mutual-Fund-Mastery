# Mutual Funds Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of mutual funds data encompassing approximately 400-600 mutual fund schemes. The dataset includes various attributes such as fund size, fund managers, fund type (equity, hybrid, debt, solution-oriented, etc.), sub-type (large-cap, mid-cap, flexi-cap, etc.), and their returns over 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years. Additionally, the dataset provides metrics like beta, alpha, standard deviation (SD), and Sortino ratio for each fund.

## Analysis
### Data Preprocessing
- The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Categorical variables were encoded for analysis, and feature engineering was performed where necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Exploratory data analysis was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.
- Insights were derived regarding the distribution of fund sizes, types, sub-types, and performance metrics.

### Advanced Analysis
- Advanced analysis techniques, including regression analysis, were utilized to understand the relationship between fund attributes and performance metrics.
- Statistical measures such as beta, alpha, standard deviation, and Sortino ratio were used to evaluate fund performance and risk.

### Dashboard Creation
- A comprehensive dashboard was developed using Power BI to visualize the analysis findings.
- The dashboard provides interactive visualizations and insights into fund performance, risk, and other key metrics.
- Users can filter and explore the data dynamically to gain deeper insights into specific funds or fund categories.

## Results
- The analysis revealed significant insights into the performance and characteristics of various mutual fund schemes.
- Trends and patterns were identified in fund performance based on fund type, size, and other attributes.
- The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to monitor and analyze mutual fund performance effectively.

## Future Work
- Further analysis could include predictive modeling to forecast future fund performance based on historical data.
- Integration with external data sources could provide additional insights into market trends and economic indicators affecting fund performance.
- Continuous monitoring and updating of the dashboard to reflect the latest data and insights.
